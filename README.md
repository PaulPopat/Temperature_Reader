# Temperature Reader

This is a tool for the Arduino Uno that will read a temperature from a thermistor and then adjust a PWM fan controller as well as displaying data to a Hitachi compatible display. It is designed for a fan controller so the PWM aspect only handles the Tache and the PWM pins. If you require power then you will need to get that from an external power supply.

A Fritzing schematic is also included, which can be used for reference when wiring.
